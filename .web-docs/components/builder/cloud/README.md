Type: `utm-cloud`
Artifact BuilderId: `naveenrajm.cloud`

The builder builds a virtual machine by importing an existing cloud image, qcow2 file.
It then boots this image, runs provisioners on this new VM, and exports that VM
to create the image. The imported machine is deleted prior to finishing the
build.

## Basic Example

Here is a basic example. This example is functional if you have an qcow2  matching
the settings here.

**HCL2**

```hcl
source "utm-cloud" "basic-example" {
  iso_url = "cloud.qcow2"
  iso_checksum = "sha256:1234567890abcdef"
  // Required to launch http server to serve cloud-init files
  http_directory =  "/path-to-cloud-file/"
  ssh_username = "vagrant"
  ssh_password = "vagrant"
  shutdown_command = "echo 'vagrant' | sudo -S /sbin/halt -h -p"
}

build {
  sources = ["sources.utm-cloud.basic-example"]
}
```

It is important to add a `shutdown_command`. By default Packer halts the virtual
machine and the file system may not be sync'd. Thus, changes made in a
provisioner might not be saved.

## Configuration Reference

There are many configuration options available for the builder. In addition to
the items listed here, you will want to look at the general configuration
references for [ISO](#iso-configuration),
[HTTP](#http-directory-configuration),
[Export](#export-configuration),
[Shutdown](#shutdown-configuration),
[Run](#run-configuration),
[Communicator](#communicator-configuration)
configuration references, which are
necessary for this build to succeed and can be found further down the page.

### Optional:

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in builder/utm/cloud/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `keep_registered` (bool) - Set this to true if you would like to keep the VM registered with
  UTM. Defaults to false.

- `skip_export` (bool) - Defaults to false. When enabled, Packer will not export the VM. Useful
  if the build output is not the resultant image, but created inside the
  VM.

- `vm_arch` (string) - QEMU system architecture of the virtual machine.
  For a QEMU virtual machine, you must specify the architecture
  Which is required in confirguration. By default, this is aarch64.
  You should use same architecture as the cloud image.

- `vm_backend` (string) - Backend to use for the virtual machine.
  Only qemu cloud images are supported.
  By default, this is qemu.

- `vm_name` (string) - This is the name of the utm file for the new virtual machine, without
  the file extension. By default this is packer-BUILDNAME, where
  "BUILDNAME" is the name of the build.

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the UtmVersionConfig struct in builder/utm/common/utm_version_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `utm_version_file` (\*string) - The path within the virtual machine to
  upload a file that contains the UTM version that was used to create
  the machine. This information can be useful for provisioning. By default
  this is .utm_version, which will generally be upload it into the
  home directory. Set to an empty string to skip uploading this file, which
  can be useful when using the none communicator.

### ISO Configuration

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ISOConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

By default, Packer will symlink, download or copy image files to the Packer
cache into a "`hash($iso_url+$iso_checksum).$iso_target_extension`" file.
Packer uses [hashicorp/go-getter](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter) in
file mode in order to perform a download.

go-getter supports the following protocols:

* Local files
* Git
* Mercurial
* HTTP
* Amazon S3

Examples:
go-getter can guess the checksum type based on `iso_checksum` length, and it is
also possible to specify the checksum type.

#### Required:

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ISOConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `iso_checksum` (string) - The checksum for the ISO file or virtual hard drive file. The type of
  the checksum is specified within the checksum field as a prefix, ex:
  "md5:{$checksum}". The type of the checksum can also be omitted and
  Packer will try to infer it based on string length. Valid values are
  "none", "{$checksum}", "md5:{$checksum}", "sha1:{$checksum}",
  "sha256:{$checksum}", "sha512:{$checksum}" or "file:{$path}". Here is a
  list of valid checksum values:
   * md5:090992ba9fd140077b0661cb75f7ce13
   * 090992ba9fd140077b0661cb75f7ce13
   * sha1:ebfb681885ddf1234c18094a45bbeafd91467911
   * ebfb681885ddf1234c18094a45bbeafd91467911
   * sha256:ed363350696a726b7932db864dda019bd2017365c9e299627830f06954643f93
   * ed363350696a726b7932db864dda019bd2017365c9e299627830f06954643f93
   * file:http://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/SHA256SUMS
   * file:file://./local/path/file.sum
   * file:./local/path/file.sum
   * none
  Although the checksum will not be verified when it is set to "none",
  this is not recommended since these files can be very large and
  corruption does happen from time to time.

- `iso_url` (string) - A URL to the ISO containing the installation image or virtual hard drive
  (VHD or VHDX) file to clone.

#### Optional:

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ISOConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `iso_urls` ([]string) - Multiple URLs for the ISO to download. Packer will try these in order.
  If anything goes wrong attempting to download or while downloading a
  single URL, it will move on to the next. All URLs must point to the same
  file (same checksum). By default this is empty and `iso_url` is used.
  Only one of `iso_url` or `iso_urls` can be specified.

- `iso_target_path` (string) - The path where the iso should be saved after download. By default will
  go in the packer cache, with a hash of the original filename and
  checksum as its name.

- `iso_target_extension` (string) - The extension of the iso file after download. This defaults to `iso`.

### Http directory configuration

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

Packer will create an http server serving `http_directory` when it is set, a
random free port will be selected and the architecture of the directory
referenced will be available in your builder.

Example usage from a builder:

```
wget http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/foo/bar/preseed.cfg
```

<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; -->


#### Optional:

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `http_directory` (string) - Path to a directory to serve using an HTTP server. The files in this
  directory will be available over HTTP that will be requestable from the
  virtual machine. This is useful for hosting kickstart files and so on.
  By default this is an empty string, which means no HTTP server will be
  started. The address and port of the HTTP server will be available as
  variables in `boot_command`. This is covered in more detail below.

- `http_content` (map[string]string) - Key/Values to serve using an HTTP server. `http_content` works like and
  conflicts with `http_directory`. The keys represent the paths and the
  values contents, the keys must start with a slash, ex: `/path/to/file`.
  `http_content` is useful for hosting kickstart files and so on. By
  default this is empty, which means no HTTP server will be started. The
  address and port of the HTTP server will be available as variables in
  `boot_command`. This is covered in more detail below.
  Example:
  ```hcl
    http_content = {
      "/a/b"     = file("http/b")
      "/foo/bar" = templatefile("${path.root}/preseed.cfg", { packages = ["nginx"] })
    }
  ```

- `http_port_min` (int) - These are the minimum and maximum port to use for the HTTP server
  started to serve the `http_directory`. Because Packer often runs in
  parallel, Packer will choose a randomly available port in this range to
  run the HTTP server. If you want to force the HTTP server to be on one
  port, make this minimum and maximum port the same. By default the values
  are `8000` and `9000`, respectively.

- `http_port_max` (int) - HTTP Port Max

- `http_bind_address` (string) - This is the bind address for the HTTP server. Defaults to 0.0.0.0 so that
  it will work with any network interface.

### Export configuration

#### Optional:

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ExportConfig struct in builder/utm/common/export_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `format` (string) - Only UTM, this specifies the output format
  of the exported virtual machine. This defaults to utm.

<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the ExportConfig struct in builder/utm/common/export_config.go; -->




### Shutdown configuration

#### Optional:

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ShutdownConfig struct in builder/utm/common/shutdown_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `shutdown_command` (string) - The command to use to gracefully shut down the
  machine once all the provisioning is done. By default this is an empty
  string, which tells Packer to just forcefully shut down the machine unless a
  shutdown command takes place inside script so this may safely be omitted. If
  one or more scripts require a reboot it is suggested to leave this blank
  since reboots may fail and specify the final shutdown command in your
  last script.

- `shutdown_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - The amount of time to wait after executing the
  shutdown_command for the virtual machine to actually shut down. If it
  doesn't shut down in this time, it is an error. By default, the timeout is
  5m or five minutes.

- `post_shutdown_delay` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - The amount of time to wait after shutting
  down the virtual machine. If you get the error
  Error removing floppy controller, you might need to set this to 5m
  or so. By default, the delay is 0s or disabled.

- `disable_shutdown` (bool) - Packer normally halts the virtual machine after all provisioners have
  run when no `shutdown_command` is defined.  If this is set to `true`, Packer
  *will not* halt the virtual machine but will assume that you will send the stop
  signal yourself through the preseed.cfg or your final provisioner.
  Packer will wait for a default of 5 minutes until the virtual machine is shutdown.
  The timeout can be changed using `shutdown_timeout` option.

### Communicator configuration

#### Optional common fields:

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `communicator` (string) - Packer currently supports three kinds of communicators:
  
  -   `none` - No communicator will be used. If this is set, most
      provisioners also can't be used.
  
  -   `ssh` - An SSH connection will be established to the machine. This
      is usually the default.
  
  -   `winrm` - A WinRM connection will be established.
  
  In addition to the above, some builders have custom communicators they
  can use. For example, the Docker builder has a "docker" communicator
  that uses `docker exec` and `docker cp` to execute scripts and copy
  files.

- `pause_before_connecting` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - We recommend that you enable SSH or WinRM as the very last step in your
  guest's bootstrap script, but sometimes you may have a race condition
  where you need Packer to wait before attempting to connect to your
  guest.
  
  If you end up in this situation, you can use the template option
  `pause_before_connecting`. By default, there is no pause. For example if
  you set `pause_before_connecting` to `10m` Packer will check whether it
  can connect, as normal. But once a connection attempt is successful, it
  will disconnect and then wait 10 minutes before connecting to the guest
  and beginning provisioning.

<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the Config struct in communicator/config.go; -->


<!-- Code generated from the comments of the CommConfig struct in builder/utm/common/comm_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `host_port_min` (int) - The minimum port to use for the Communicator port on the host machine which is forwarded
  to the SSH or WinRM port on the guest machine. By default this is 2222.

- `host_port_max` (int) - The maximum port to use for the Communicator port on the host machine which is forwarded
  to the SSH or WinRM port on the guest machine. Because Packer often runs in parallel,
  Packer will choose a randomly available port in this range to use as the
  host port. By default this is 4444.

- `skip_nat_mapping` (bool) - Defaults to false. When enabled, Packer
  does not setup forwarded port mapping for communicator (SSH or WinRM) requests and uses ssh_port or winrm_port
  on the host to communicate to the virtual machine.
