- `hypervisor` (bool) - Set this to true if you would like to use Hypervisor
  Defaults to false.

- `uefi_boot` (bool) - Set this to true if you would like to use UEFI firmware to boot with
  UTM. Defaults to false.

- `disk_size` (uint) - The size, in megabytes, of the hard disk to create for the VM. By
  default, this is 40000 (about 40 GB).

- `hard_drive_interface` (string) - The type of controller that the primary hard drive is attached to,
  defaults to VirtIO. When set to usb, the drive is attached to an USB
  controller. When set to scsi, the drive is attached to an  SCSI
  controller. When set to nvme, the drive is attached to an NVMe
  controller. When set to virtio, the drive is attached to a VirtIO
  controller. Please note that when you use "nvme",
  and you may need to enable EFI mode for nvme to work (this note is from VirtualBox)

- `iso_interface` (string) - The type of controller that the ISO is attached to, defaults to usb.
  When set to nvme, the drive is attached to an NVMe controller.
  When set to virtio, the drive is attached to a VirtIO controller.

- `disk_additional_size` ([]uint) - Additional disks to create. Attachment starts at 1 since 0
  is the default disk. Each value represents the disk image size in MiB.
  Each additional disk uses the same disk parameters as the default disk.
  Unset by default.

- `resize_cloud_image` (bool) - Wheather to resize the cloud image to the disk size. Defaults to false.
  If set to true, the cloud image will be resized to the disk size.
  Required qemu-img to be installed in the system.

- `use_cd` (bool) - Pass cloud-init data to the VM using a CD-ROM. Defaults to false.
  If set to true, you must provide cd_files with the path to the cloud-init
  data and cd_label with value "cidata".
  If set to false, you must provide http_directory with the cloud-init data.

- `keep_registered` (bool) - Set this to true if you would like to keep the VM registered with
  UTM. Defaults to false.

- `skip_export` (bool) - Defaults to false. When enabled, Packer will not export the VM. Useful
  if the build output is not the resultant image, but created inside the
  VM.

- `vm_icon` (string) - UTM VM icon.

- `vm_arch` (string) - QEMU system architecture of the virtual machine.
  For a QEMU virtual machine, you must specify the architecture
  Which is required in confirguration. By default, this is aarch64.
  You should use same architecture as the cloud image.

- `vm_backend` (string) - Backend to use for the virtual machine.
  Only qemu cloud images are supported.
  By default, this is qemu.

- `vm_name` (string) - This is the name of the utm file for the new virtual machine, without
  the file extension. By default this is packer-BUILDNAME, where
  "BUILDNAME" is the name of the build.
